Slice of Life to me is the presentation that Anime utilizes to its most powerful. The experiences and journeys I've gone on with characters through this medium feel incredibly personal in a way that I don't think any other medium has accomplished for me. And within these shows there always exists an element in them that I either have to casually ignore or create an external reason for them to exist diagetically for the show. And that is what I've come to think of as the Voyeurism of Anime.

Every experience I have with media is very much a conversation for me. A chat that you have with the black box that is Creator and Myself about our life experience, expectations and regrets. You can just look at my twitter timeline to get the barest hint of that. For that reason I have always connected incredibly deeply with the presentation form of Slice of Life. From Chef and Inside Llewyn Davis to Hidamari Sketch and Ichigo Mashimaro, Slice of Life has been a large way that I've been able to reach an understanding of living
outside of my life experiences and personal expectations.

Part of what's so powerful about Slice of Life is that it is by definition a very vulnerable way to tell a story. The editorializing it excludes enables presenting you with incredible intimate moments from a persons life through a structure designed to create an empathetic response. For me, characters in a Slice of Life feel far more truthful to me than through any medium, specifically because I feel I have a greater understanding of their desires and insecurities because I've experienced those alongside them.

Because of that I feel that there is a very deep trust that has to exist between Creator and Character that the story being told has to be meaningful enough to expose them in such a vulnerable way. That the power of Slice of Life is best utilized when telling a truth that could only be truly understood through the incredibly personal experience that Slice of Life engenders.

When meaning plays second fiddle to exposition the conversation instead turns towards an exploitative contract between the Creator and You to instead peer into the personal lives of the Characters for personal gratification. And the only truth that ends up being shared can only be your desires and expectations of what the Characters lives can grant to You. That their lives value to you only comes through the exposure of their intimate moments.



It is important when talking about Characters to acknowledge that they are architected with particular intentions. Their behaviors and objectives exist to serve particular functions within a story. Discussing a character without discussing the narrative is fundamentally ignoring who the character is. Their context has to be recognized. 

The larger restriction comes from the external objectification of the character. They instantly beg into question the metanarrative of the series in order to properly understood their role in any story. This character exists to be a dutz, klutz, moe-gap token. They do not exist to function within the story. They clamp down on the expressiveness that can be used by the Creators. When you have a character who has no agency, their actions always have to originate externally. The story has to tug them along to include them, they serve as a dead weight to any story that will be told.

Moe has become a catch-all term to identify this, when a set of a characters traits exists as an emblem of their Creators desires. What turns this insidious is the instant pattern of what Creators were using as moe. It creates a set of personalities that can only be expressed within any story through an objectified lens. These characters by nature do not have freedom of expression within any story, and can not freely communicate their experiences to You. They've had their voices removed. They exist purely to be an object of your gaze.













Character exploitation is when a character is designed without any agency in a narrative. To serve merely as a totem, these characters do not exist to be expressions of personality, but lodestones of appeal.
