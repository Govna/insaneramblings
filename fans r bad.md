​	Media in essence is a relationship between the Creator and an audience. This is not strictly defined. People can have this relationship with unmade goods like sunsets, formations of tree growths, the biology of creatures. They can have these relationships with tools whose design and construction is purely functional and without care about the relationship. The only important part of this relationship is that there is a conversation, imagined or otherwise, between the Creator of the Media and the Viewer of the Media.

​	When it comes to discussion around anime I've found that there is a fundamental disconnect with how people discuss their relationship with the media. Mainly that they first insist that intentions of the Creator are wholly separate from the experience of the Viewer, and then insist that the Creator is incredibly talented at their craft and must be worshiped and protected. I posit that the former declaration is in service to the latter, that the Viewer is seeking to protect the Creator from infidels that might otherwise turn the Creator from the path of creating content the Viewer desires.

​	The greatest issue I have with this relationship is that it fundamentally limits the bandwidth of communication the Viewer can have with the media of the Creator. It completely blocks off more fundamental appreciations of the creation in service of the attitude of protecting it.
